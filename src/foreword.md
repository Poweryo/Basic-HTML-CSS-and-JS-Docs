# Foreword
*by **Quang Huy (aka @LazyYuuki)** and somewhat ChatGPT*

Welcome everyone to this mini workshop on how to build a web application using only HTML, CSS and Javascript the old traditional way (which is also arguably one of the best way to improve your skill as a frontend developer).

This is the first technical workshop that I have ever hosted, so if there is any feedback, feel free to reach out to me at **@LazyYuuki** on:

## A bit about myself

My web development journey first started when I decided to take on a hackathon challenge three years ago, and the rest was history! Since then, I've been working in the field for more than two years, building some seriously awesome production-grade websites and applications, both on my own and as part of amazing teams!

I have a lot of passion in software engineering with a special interest in Open Source Projects, clean code, and software engineering best practices!

My interests in the tech world are as diverse as they come. From the sheer elegance of Rust to the boundless possibilities of JavaScript, from the mind-bending concepts of functional programming to the nifty efficiency of containerization.

Oh, and of course technical documentation. I firmly believe it's the backbone of any successful project, and I take pride in detailed documentation and well-documented code.

Recently, I've also delved into the intricate world of AI and ML! I love getting my hands dirty with fundamental implementations of these cutting-edge technologies (in Rust preferably)!

So, whether you want to geek out about Rust, explore the wonders of functional programming, chat about containerization, or just have a good ol' tech chit-chat, feel free to hit me up! I'm always up for a fun and educational conversation about anything related to technology!

## Journey into the world of web dev

**TLDR**: *Web dev is cool. Don't skip your fundamental. Progress slowly and solidly. And don't forget to have fun while learning!*

First of all, I want to applause your decision to step out of your comfort zone and try to learn something new (if you are not new, then I don't know what are you doing here, but I hope you still learn something regardless). Web dev is more than just the development of the User Interface that you interact with on a particular website. It is also about the optimization of your web application loadtime, managing security over the web, improving Search Engine Optimization and more over the lifetime of a website and web applications. It is often not so visible to the users how much effort is put into building a truly amazing user experiences on the web, and so we, as web devs, are always trying out new tools, techniques and paradigms to try to push the boundary of the web just a little bit more.

However, it is a good reminder that among all the new shiny tools such as React, Vue, Svelte or Solid, you fundamental is what matter the most. Sure, you can probably spend just an afternoon or two to pick up React and build something quite decent by following some tutorial online, but it is will be hard pressed for you to progress further without having the fundamental of what are those tools doing and why do they works. It is easy to gloss over the fundamental, but as a person who has hit his growing plateau in web dev multiple time, I caution you to tread the path carefully, as **if it is not painful now, it will be painful later**. So it is good that you sign up for this workshop, to try to learn from the basic and fundamental, instead of trying to chase the newest and shiniest thing. A good foundation will give you the strength to withstand the test of time as libraries and frameworks come and goes. By the way, Javascript is here to stay, so don't worry about it going anywhere, anytime in our lifetime.

With that being said, web dev is **FUN**. If anything it is probably the most fun a software engineer can get, because there is no boundary to what you can build and share on the web. The community is vibrant and there is always something new being released every months (or even week at this point). So to keep your motivation high, remember, the most important thing in web dev is to try new things and have fun (but of course don't forget to hone your fundamental).

Well that was longer than intended, but it is my first ever technical workshop so forgive me for being a bit more enthusiastic. I wish you well on your journey and that this workshop helps somewhat in that journey!
